# Mod1-GameOn
Mod 1 Project: The DOM Based Game
Connect Fizzour

This project is a slightly modified version of the classic game, Connect 4 but the objective is the same. Two players take turns inputting their specific color game pieces until one player has managed to "connect" four pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This is the first project that finalizes the first module of my software engineering cohort. The main basis of the project was written in JavaScript utilizing the Document Object Model, with some HTML and CSS code as well.

I was unable to get the GitHub Pages to load properly due to the following error: 

"Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting 'assets/css/style.scss':                     No such file or directory @ dir_chdir - /github/workspace/docs"

but am researching possible solutions currently.

The actual link to the repo is: https://github.com/jpxyzog/mod1-gameon.

While completed to meet the project requirements, I will be updating and adding additional features in the near future.
