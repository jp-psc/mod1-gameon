Mod 1 Project: The DOM Based Game
Connect Fizzour

This project is a slightly modified version of the classic game, Connect 4 but the objective is the same. Two players take turns inputting their specific color game pieces until one player has managed to "connect" four pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This is the first project that finalizes the first module of my software engineering cohort.
